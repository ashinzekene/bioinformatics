# How do we compare biological sequences

This course alignement of genome and peptide sequences.

We are much familiar with Central Dogma (DNA -> RNA -> Proteins), however there is a __Non Ribsomal__ process used by bacteria for synthesizing proteins facilitated by an enzyme known as __NRP Sythetase (Non-Ribosomal Protein Synthetase)__.
To crack this non-ribosomal code used by bacteria for making proteins, we first have to compare proteins created by this process. We have to be able to align these sequences to be able to discover the hidden messages that are present in this process.


For a lot of human genes, there occurs a mouse analog however these genes occur at different arrangements. This is due to mutation in the genome known as __genome rearrangements__ kind of like earthquakes. This might even occur across chromosomes. We would find out what parts of the genome are more prone to this rearrangements if they exist kind of like fault lines for earth quakes.
